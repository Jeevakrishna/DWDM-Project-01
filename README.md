SVC : In data mining, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a supervised learning algorithm that classifies data by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. It works by maximizing the margin between the closest points of different classes, known as support vectors, to improve classification accuracy.

Logistic Regression :Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on one or more predictor variables. It uses the logistic function to model the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the dependent variable.

MLPClassifier : Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier  is a type of artificial neural network used for supervised learning tasks, particularly classification. It consists of multiple layers of neurons (input, hidden, and output layers) that use a backpropagation algorithm to learn from data and make predictions. It can model complex, non-linear relationships between features and target labels.
