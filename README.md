SVC : In data mining, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a supervised learning algorithm that classifies data by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. It works by maximizing the margin between the closest points of different classes, known as support vectors, to improve classification accuracy.

**Logistic Regression** :Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on one or more predictor variables. It uses the logistic function to model the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the dependent variable.

**MLPClassifier** : Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier  is a type of artificial neural network used for supervised learning tasks, particularly classification. It consists of multiple layers of neurons (input, hidden, and output layers) that use a backpropagation algorithm to learn from data and make predictions. It can model complex, non-linear relationships between features and target labels.

**classification_report**: It provides a detailed summary of a classifier's performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. It's helpful for evaluating the balance between precision and recall in multi-class problems.

**confusion_matrix**: A table that shows the actual vs. predicted classifications, with true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It's a key tool for analyzing the performance of a classification model beyond simple accuracy.

**accuracy_score**: This metric calculates the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. It’s a basic indicator of a model’s performance but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets.

**roc_auc_score**: The ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve) score measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes. It evaluates the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, with a score of 1 being perfect classification.
